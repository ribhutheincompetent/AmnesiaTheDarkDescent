Amnesia: The Dark Descent Source Code
=======================
Here is everything you need to build (I'm still looking for build instructions to figure out how the hell I'm gonna do it but ok) Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Included are project files for Visual Studio 2010 and CMake for Linux & macOS (that I'm ripping my hairs because they are not super clear on the build flags needed to do this).

This is probably also the most enjoyable engine to work upon, hopefully people would be able to make their own standalone games with it (then again, I've been hoping for the same for [morrowind](https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw), so I don't expect too much).

Contributing Code
